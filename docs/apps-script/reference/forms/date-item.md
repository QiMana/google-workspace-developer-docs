# Class DateItem

## Page Summary

- DateItem allows respondents to indicate a date and can be accessed or created from a Form.
- DateItem objects can be duplicated, and their help text, ID, index, points, and title can be retrieved.
- The DateItem includes methods to check if a year is included, if the question is required, and to set general feedback, help text, year inclusion, points, required status, and title.
- The `createResponse(response)` method generates an ItemResponse for the DateItem, using the date information from a provided Date object while ignoring time fields.

A question item that allows the respondent to indicate a date. Items can be accessed or created from a `Form`. When used in a quiz, these items are graded.

```
// Open a form by ID and add a new date item.
const form = FormApp.openById('1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz');
const item = form.addDateItem();
item.setTitle('When were you born?');
```
