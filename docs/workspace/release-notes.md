## October 27, 2025

**Google Calendar API**

v3

Feature

**Generally available starting November 10, 2025**:

Secondary calendars will now have a single data owner. This applies to both existing and newly created calendars. In the Calendar API, the data owner's email address will be in the read-only `dataOwner` field in the `Calendars` and `CalendarList` resources.

To prevent unintended actions and undesired states, the following new restrictions apply:

- Only the data owner can delete secondary calendars.
- The data owner's access level cannot be changed from the default `owner` access.
- The data owner cannot remove an owned calendar from their calendar list. They can hide it from their UI.

When a new secondary calendar is created, the authenticated user that makes the request is the data owner. We recommend that you use user authentication to create secondary calendars. Data ownership can be transferred in the Google Calendar UI.

For more details, see the documentation for [`Calendars`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/v3/reference/calendars) and [`CalendarList`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/v3/reference/calendarList) closer to November 10.

## October 22, 2025

**Chat API**

v1

Announcement

**Generally available**: When sending [private messages](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#private), Chat apps can now include interactive [accessory widgets](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#add-accessory-widgets).

Feature

**Generally available**: We're enhancing membership roles in Chat spaces by introducing a new membership role type. In the Chat UI, existing space managers are now owners and a new manager role is added.

Previously, there were three membership role types in Chat API. `MEMBERSHIP_ROLE_UNSPECIFIED`, which meant a user wasn't a member but could be invited. `ROLE_MEMBER`, which meant a user was a member of the space. And `ROLE_MANAGER`, which meant a user was a space manager.

Now, in the Chat UI, `ROLE_MANAGER` users are called owners; this is a cosmetic change so permissions and the API enum remain the same. To help space owners administer spaces, we're introducing `ROLE_ASSISTANT_MANAGER` which is called manager in the UI. Possible membership roles include:

- `MEMBERSHIP_ROLE_UNSPECIFIED`: Default value. For users: they aren't a member of the space, but can be invited. For Google Groups: they're always assigned this role.
- `ROLE_MEMBER`: A member of the space. In the Chat UI, this role is called **Member**. Members have basic permissions, like reading messages in a space. Managers and Owners can grant them additional permissions, like adding or removing members, editing space details, and turning history on and off.
- `ROLE_ASSISTANT_MANAGER`: A space manager. In the Chat UI, this role is called **Manager**. By default, managers have permission to make other members managers, delete messages, and change space permissions.
- `ROLE_MANAGER`: A space owner. In the Chat UI, this role is called **Owner**. Owners have the broadest set of permissions, including permission to make other members owners or delete the space.

To learn more, see [Update a user's membership in a Google Chat space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/update-members) and [`MembershipRole`](https://developers.google.com//workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.members#membershiprole) in the Chat API reference documentation.

## July 16, 2025

**Google Drive API**

v3

Change

The Drive API has changed how download, print, and copy restrictions are applied.

Users with the role of `owner` or `organizer` can apply restrictions to other users with `writer` roles, in addition to `reader` roles. Users can directly apply restrictions on files using the `itemDownloadRestriction` field within the [`DownloadRestrictionsMetadata`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files#downloadrestrictionsmetadata) object. Determination of whether file restrictions can be changed is controlled by the new `capabilities.canChangeItemDownloadRestriction` field.

Similarly, users with the role of shared drive `organizer` can directly apply restrictions on shared drives using the `downloadRestriction` field within the [`Restrictions`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/drives#Drive.FIELDS.restrictions) object. Determination of whether shared drive restrictions can be changed is also controlled by the `capabilities.canChangeDownloadRestriction` field.

While the previous field (`copyRequiresWriterPermission`) that controlled download, print, and copy restrictions is still available, the functionality is different for both reading from and writing to the field. We recommend that you use the new `DownloadRestriction` object to enforce how users can download, print, and copy files.

For more information about how download, print, and copy restrictions are now applied for My Drive and shared drive files, see:

- [Protect file content](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/content-restrictions#download-print-copy)
- [Manage shared drives](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-shareddrives#download-print-copy)

**Google Apps Script** Deprecated

[Google Analytics 4 has replaced Universal Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528), which means the Apps Script Advanced Service for Google Analytics Management API and Reporting API is deprecated. Use the [Google Analytics Data API Advanced Service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/analyticsdata) instead.

**Google Workspace add-ons**

Breaking

**Developer Preview:** Starting on June 16, 2025, the following default Apps Script function names for [Google Chat app triggers](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/chat/build#triggers) will change:

- For **Added to space** triggers, the default function name will change from `onAddToSpace` to `onAddedToSpace`.
- For **Removed from space** triggers, the default function name will change from `onRemoveFromSpace` to `onRemovedFromSpace`.

If your Chat app responds to being added or removed from Chat spaces, you can address this breaking change and avoid any potential errors by doing one of the following:

- In your Apps Script project, update the name of your functions to `onAddedToSpace` and `onRemovedFromSpace`. If required, [create another versioned deployment](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/versions) of your Apps Script project and save the new deployment ID in the **Chat API Configuration** page in the Google Cloud console.
- In the Google Cloud console, open the **Chat API Configuration page** and in the **Triggers** section, update the function name for the **Added to space** and **Removed from space** triggers so that they use the function name that you're currently using in your Apps Script project.

To learn how to update your Chat app configuration in the Google Cloud console, see [Configure a Google Chat app](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/chat/configure).

For Google Workspace add-ons that extend Google Chat, the `invoked_function` field is no longer part of the [Common event object](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/concepts/event-objects#common_event_object). Use the `parameters` field to determine and handle user interactions.

If your application doesn't depend on the `invoked_function` field, no action is needed.

If your application used the `invoked_function` field, [see to the documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/chat/collect-information#transfer) for an example that uses the `parameters` field to create interactive widgets.

## May 05, 2025

**Google Workspace add-ons**

Fixed

For Google Workspace add-ons that extend Google Chat, `event_time` timestamps are serialized and match the serialization of legacy Google Chat apps. You can now use the same timestamp-handling logic in both legacy Chat apps, and in your Workspace add-ons that extend Google Chat.

Previously, timestamps were serialized in the following format:

```
"eventTime": {
 "seconds": 1.742601948E9
 "nanos": 7.01868E8
}
```

After this fix, timestamps are serialized in the following format that shows the date and time:

```
"eventTime": "2025-03-24T16:31:21.165203Z"
```

[See the `Event` object in the Google Chat API](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/Event).

## April 23, 2025

**Google Apps Script** Fixed

Between approximately September 2024 and March 2025, for Google Sheets modifications made by time-based Apps Script triggers, a bug caused incorrect OAuth App IDs and App Names to be logged in the Google Admin console.

This logging issue did not impact the functionality of Apps Script or Google Sheets. A fix was deployed on March 27, 2025, preventing future incorrect logging. Historical logs will not be corrected.

To learn more about Apps Script and audit logs, see [Monitor and control Apps Script use in your Google Workspace organization](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/admin/monitor-use).

## March 23, 2023

**Google Meet**

Announcement

**Live Sharing SDK**

Alpha version of a new SDK major release. While the internals of this SDK are production-ready, the API surface of this alpha is subject to additional breaking changes—such as new features—before a final 2.0.0 release is published. The following changes are part of this release:

- `Co-Doing`:
	- `CoDoingSession`: Renamed `broadcastStateUpdate()` to `setGlobalState()`.
		- `CoDoingSessionDelegate`:
		- `Eliminated onCoDoingStateQuery()`. If initial state must be set upon connecting to live sharing, call `CoDoingSession#setGlobalState()` explicitly instead.
				- Renamed `onCoDoingStateChanged()` to `onGlobalStateChanged()`.
- `Co-Watching`:
	- `CoWatchingSession`: Removed previously-deprecated `notifyPlayoutRate()` overload.
		- `CoWatchingSessionDelegate`:
		- Renamed `onCoWatchingStateQuery()` to `onStateQuery()`.
				- `onStateQuery()` now returns a `QueriedCoWatchingState`, which is a subset of `CoWatchingState`. Update the return type and either:
			- Continue building and returning a `CoWatchingState`...
						- Or, simplify the implementation by constructing a simpler `QueriedCoWatchingState` instance.
- `LiveSharingClient`:
	- Replaced the following methods with a builder pattern:
		- `connectMeeting()` / `disconnectMeeting()`
				- `beginCoDoing()` / `endCoDoing()`
				- `beginCoWatching()` / `endCoWatching()`
- Instead of calling `connectMeeting()` followed by `beginCoDoing()` (or co-watching), call `newSessionBuilder().withCoDoing().begin()`.
- `begin()` returns a new `LiveSharingSession` instance:
	- To end the session, call `endSession()`.
		- To set participant metadata after the session has started, call `setParticipantMetadata()`.
		- To access the co-doing/co-watching session, call `getCoDoing()` / `getCoWatching()`.
		- To access information about the current meeting, call `getMeetingInfo()`.
- To set up participant metadata and register a delegate, call `withParticipantMetadata()` as part of the session builder chain.
- Added `registerMeetingStatusListener()` / `unregisterMeetingStatusListener()` and deprecated \`queryMeeting().
- Artifacts released: `com.google.android.livesharing:livesharing:2.0.0-alpha01`.

## June 06, 2022

**Google Apps Script** Change

You can now call functions in separate files before they're parsed. Previously, the V8 runtime required a script file to be parsed before any other file could call the functions it defines.

Now, the order of files in the Apps Script editor doesn't matter. This means that you can call a function in a different file to assign a value to a global variable—the function is always defined before it's called. This behavior reflects that of the legacy Rhino runtime.

## May 25, 2022

**Google Meet** Fixed

**Live Sharing SDK**: Addressed some race conditions.

Feature

**Live Sharing SDK**:

- Surfaced `LiveSharingMeetingInfo.Builder` to API consumers for ease-of-testing.
- Added new overload of `LiveSharingClientFactory#getClient,` permitting API consumers to provide their own executor services. Consumers can begin using this API, but the SDK does not yet respect the provided executors. This will occur in a future release.
- Added error code mechanism to `LiveSharingException`, allowing common errors to be tagged with a canonical code. Currently supports one error code: `MEET_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`.
- Enabled `#queryMeeting()` feature.
- Artifact released `com.google.android.livesharing:livesharing:1.0.0-eap05`.

Change

**Live Sharing SDK**: Removed internal handler creation for ongoing call detector. If LSA does not provide a handler, the registered receiver will run on the UI thread.

## April 08, 2019

**Google Apps Script** Change

The behavior of the [Google Cloud (GCP) projects](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/cloud-platform-projects) used by scripts has been altered. Now, the [default GCP projects](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/cloud-platform-projects#default_cloud_platform_projects) that Apps Script creates for new scripts are hidden and script owners can't access them directly. Admins and domain users with the `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the parenting GCP folder can still access default GCP projects.

If you need access to a script's GCP project (because you wish to publish it or take a similar action), it's best to switch your script to use a [standard GCP project](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/cloud-platform-projects#standard_cloud_platform_projects).

## April 23, 2015

**Google Apps Script**

Announcement

- Add-ons are now out of developer preview. This means anyone can now [publish](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/publish-addons) an add-on. New add-ons will still be reviewed prior to publishing, but the publishing process has been streamlined.
- Add-ons can now be developed and published from standalone scripts (as opposed to scripts bound to a Sheet, Doc, or Form). The add-on must still operate on a Sheet, Doc, or Form, but the script does not need to be bound to a single master file. Developing from a standalone script is preferred in that it makes collaboration and testing easier.
- Add-on scripts in development can be [tested](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/test-addons) to ensure they behave as intended.

Deprecated

The [`DocsList` service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/support/sunset), which was [deprecated in 2014](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/support/sunset), has been sunset and no longer functions. Users relying on `DocsList` should switch to [`DriveApp`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/drive/drive-app).

## March 31, 2015

**Gmail API**

v1

Change

New scopes for labels and inserting messages to better protect users and accommodate apps that don't need full mailbox data access:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.insert`: Allows the [`messages.insert`](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/insert) and [`messages.import`](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/import) methods only.
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels`: Allows all [label operations](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/labels).

## March 19, 2015

**Google Apps Script**

Feature

- Added the ability to [publish add-ons for domain-wide installation](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/publish-for-domains). This lets an admin of a Google Apps domain install and authorize a Docs, Sheets, or Forms [add-on](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview) for all users in the domain if the add-on is published to the [Google Apps Marketplace](https://developers.google.com/apps-marketplace). If the developer has already published a Google Apps Marketplace app that is closely related to their add-on, they can also choose to bundle the add-on with the Marketplace app so that admins install both the app and the add-on together.
- Added the ability to [change the Google Developers Console project](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/cloud-platform-projects#switching_to_a_different_standard_gcp_project) that a script uses for authorization. This feature is most commonly used to bundle an add-on with a Google Apps Marketplace app, as above.

## March 18, 2015

**Gmail API**

v1

Feature

The [`messages.insert` method](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/insert) now supports the `deleted` request parameter and lets you set `SENT` and `DRAFT` labels.

## March 04, 2015

**Google Apps Script** Deprecated

Deprecated the URL Fetch service's class `OAuthConfig`, which provided the ability to connect to OAuth 1.0 APIs. This has been replaced by the open source library [OAuth1 for Apps Script](https://github.com/googlesamples/apps-script-oauth1). See the [migration guide](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/migration/oauth-config) for more information.

## February 25, 2015

**Gmail API**

v1

Feature

The [`history.list` method](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.history/list) now provides details of the change type in each history record. For example, using the `messagesAdded`, `messagesDeleted`, `labelsAdded`, or `labelsDeleted` enums, it's possible to easily tell how a message was changed and typically avoids the need for additional calls to synchronize your client.

## February 11, 2015

**Gmail API**

v1

Feature

The [`messages.import` method](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/import) now supports the following parameters to better support `Email Migration` use cases:

	- `PageProtection`
		- `Spreadsheet.getSheetProtection()`
		- `Spreadsheet.setSheetProtection(permissions)`
		- `Sheet.getSheetProtection()`
		- `Sheet.setSheetProtection(permissions)`
- Replaced the method [`SpreadsheetApp.open(file)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet-app#open\(File\)), which takes a `File` object from the deprecated `DocsList` service as a parameter, with a version that takes a `File` object from the `Drive` service instead. The new method has the same name.
- Changed the Document service methods [`Text.getFontFamily()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/text#getFontFamily\(\)) and [`Text.setFontFamily(fontFamilyName)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/text#setFontFamily\(String\)) to use string names for font families instead of the [`FontFamily` enum](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/font-family), and consequently deprecated `FontFamily`.

Feature

Added the following class, enum, and methods to the Spreadsheet service, to give precise control over protected sheets and ranges:

- [`Protection`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/protection)
- [`ProtectionType`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/protection-type)
- [`Range.canEdit()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range#canEdit\(\))
- [`Range.isEndColumnBounded()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range#isEndColumnBounded\(\))
- [`Range.isEndRowBounded()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range#isEndRowBounded\(\))
- [`Range.isStartColumnBounded()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range#isStartColumnBounded\(\))
- [`Range.isStartRowBounded()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range#isStartRowBounded\(\))
- [`Range.protect()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/range#protect\(\))
- [`Sheet.getProtections(type)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/sheet#getProtections\(ProtectionType\))
- [`Sheet.protect()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/sheet#protect\(\))
- [`Spreadsheet.getProtections(type)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet#getProtections\(ProtectionType\))

Fixed

[Issue 4617](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=4617): HTML service pages that use the new [`IFRAME` sandbox mode](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/html/sandbox-mode) now render correctly in Firefox.

Change

Changed several [`Spreadsheet` methods](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet) that previously returned void so that they now return a `Spreadsheet` object that can be used to chain method calls.

## February 02, 2015

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Feature

**Reports API**: We have added the [Mobile Device](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/usage-ref-appendix-a/customers-mobile) customer usage report to the [`customerUsageReports.get` method](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/customerUsageReports/get). This new report allows you to view information about mobile device usage in your domains.

**Gmail API**

v1

Feature

You can now specify `message.labelIds` on [`messages.import` requests](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/import) to automatically apply the given labels to the message.

Breaking

The default behavior no longer automatically adds `INBOX` and `UNREAD` labels to [`messages.import` emails](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/import). When `message.labelIds` isn't specified, imported mail is only visible in All Mail. If you want `INBOX` or `UNREAD` labels applied, specify them in the `message.labelIds` field.

## January 15, 2015

**Gmail API**

v1

Change

Increased the default [per-user quotas](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/quota) from 25 units/user/second to 250 units/user/second and adjusted some method costs slightly.

## December 11, 2014

**Google Apps Script**

Deprecated

- [Deprecated](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/support/sunset) both the [UI service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/ui-service) and the [`DocsList` service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/docs-list). As announced in the [blog post](https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2014/12/speeding-up-htmlservice.html), the `DocsList` service will be turned off on April 20, 2015, and the UI service will be turned off on June 30, 2015. To create user interfaces, use the [HTML service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html) instead. To replace the `DocsList` service, use the [`Drive` service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/drive) instead.
- [Removed](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/support/sunset) the [Domain service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/migration/domain), as [announced earlier in the year](https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2014/05/deprecating-scriptdb-and-domain-service.html).

Feature

Added a new [`IFRAME` sandbox mode](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/html/sandbox-mode) for HTML service that imposes many fewer restrictions than the other sandbox modes and runs much faster. However, `IFRAME` mode does not work at all in certain older browsers, including Internet Explorer 9.

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Feature

**Reports API**: We have added the [Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/activity-ref-appendix-a/calendar-event-names) audit report to the [`activities.list` method](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/activities/list). This new report allows you to view information about changes to calendars and calendar events for users in your domain.

## December 01, 2014

**Google Apps Script**

Feature

- Added five new `FormApp` methods:
	- [`Form.getShuffleQuestions()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form#getShuffleQuestions\(\)): Determines whether the order of the questions on each page of the form is randomized.
		- [`Form.hasLimitOneResponsePerUser()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form#hasLimitOneResponsePerUser\(\)): Determines whether the form allows only one response per respondent. If the value is true, the script cannot submit form responses at all.
		- [`Form.setLimitOneResponsePerUser(enabled)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form#setLimitOneResponsePerUser\(Boolean\)): Sets whether the form allows only one response per respondent. The default for new forms is false. If the value is set to true, the script cannot submit form responses at all.
		- [`Form.setShuffleQuestions(shuffle)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form#setShuffleQuestions\(Boolean\)): Sets whether the order of the questions on each page of the form is randomized.
		- [`Form.shortenFormUrl(url)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form#shortenFormUrl\(String\)): Converts a long URL for a form to a short URL.
- Added two new `SpreadsheetApp` methods:
	- [`Sheet.insertImage(blob, column, row)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/sheet#insertImage\(Blob,Integer,Integer\)): Inserts a [`Blob`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/blob) as an image in the sheet at a given row and column.
		- [`Sheet.insertImage(blob, column, row, offsetX, offsetY)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/sheet#insertImage\(Blob,Integer,Integer,Integer,Integer\)): Inserts a [`Blob`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/blob) as an image in the sheet at a given row and column, with a pixel offset.

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Feature

**Reports API**: We have added the [ChromeOS Devices customer usage report](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/usage-ref-appendix-a/customers-cros) to the [`customerUsageReports.get` method](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/customerUsageReports/get). This new report allows you to view information about ChromeOS device usage in your domains.

## October 23, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Announcement

[Add-ons](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview) are now [available in Google Forms](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/quickstart/forms-add-on). As with add-ons for Docs and Sheets, Forms add-ons are in developer preview, so you must [apply to publish them](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/publish-addons).

Deprecated

Fixed

[Issue 3928](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3928): The `Document` method `setSelection`, the `Sheet` method `activate`, and the `Spreadsheet` methods `setActiveRange` and `setActiveSelection` now work correctly if they are called from an `onOpen` or `onEdit` trigger.

## October 22, 2014

**Gmail API**

v1

Feature

You can now specify the return format for the [`threads.get` method](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/threads/get). The available formats are `full`, `metadata`, and `minimal`, similar to the `messages.get` method. The raw format isn't allowed for the `threads.get` to avoid unexpectedly large amounts of data being returned.

## October 16, 2014

**Gmail API**

v1

Feature

The [`getProfile` method](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/getProfile) provides mailbox-wide information like current history ID and total message and thread counts.

## October 14, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Feature

[Add-ons](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview) for Google Sheets and Docs can now use [time-driven installable triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable#time-driven_triggers).

## October 06, 2014

**Gmail API**

v1

Feature

Added new fields to the `Labels` resource to simplify counting how many messages have a given label applied:

- `messagesTotal`
- `messagesUnread`
- `threadsTotal`
- `threadsUnread`

Feature

Added a new [`IMPORTANT` label](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/labels) to match functionality with the Gmail UI.

## September 30, 2014

**Google Apps Script**

Feature

- Added the [`LinearOptimizationService`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/optimization), which allows scripts to model and solve linear and mixed-integer linear programs.
- [Add-ons](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview) for Google Sheets and Docs can now use most [installable triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable#installable_triggers_in_add-ons), although they still cannot use time-driven triggers (sometimes called clock triggers).
- Added an [installable open trigger](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable) for Google Docs. Like the installable open triggers for Sheets and Forms, this trigger is similar to the simple `onOpen()` trigger, but allows the triggered function to call services that require authorization, if the user has authorized the script ahead of time.
- Added several new `ScriptApp` methods, classes, and enums to support installable triggers in add-ons:
	- [`AuthorizationInfo`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/authorization-info): An object used to determine whether the user needs to authorize this script to use one or more services, and to provide the URL for an authorization dialog. Returned by `ScriptApp.getAuthorizationInfo()`.
		- [`AuthorizationStatus`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/authorization-status#getAuthorizationUrl\(\)): An enumeration denoting the authorization status of a script. Returned by `AuthorizationInfo.getAuthorizationStatus()`.
		- [`DocumentTriggerBuilder`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/document-trigger-builder): A builder for document triggers. Returned by `TriggerBuilder.forDocument(...)`.
		- [`ScriptApp.getUserTriggers(...)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/script-app#getUserTriggers\(Document\)): Gets all installable triggers owned by this user in the given document, spreadsheet, or form.

Change

The `UiService` widget `DocsListDialog` now requires that you call [`DocsListDialog.setOAuthToken(oAuthToken)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/ui/docs-list-dialog#setOAuthToken\(String\)) before calling [`DocsListDialog.showDocsPicker()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/ui/docs-list-dialog#showDocsPicker\(\)).

## September 25, 2014

**Gmail API**

v1

Change

The `messages.insert` method defaults to using `receivedTime` and the `messages.import` method defaults to using `dateHeader`.

## September 08, 2014

**Gmail API**

v1

Change

When you use the [`messages.get` method](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/get), you can request the metadata return format to return only the email headers and metadata such as identifiers and labels.

## September 04, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Deprecated

Replaced the `CacheService` methods `getPrivateCache()` and `getPublicCache()` and the `LockService` methods `getPrivateLock()` and `getPublicLock()` with [`getUserCache()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache/cache-service#getUserCache\(\)), [`getScriptCache()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache/cache-service#getScriptCache\(\)), [`getUserLock()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/lock/lock-service#getUserLock\(\)), and [`getScriptLock()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/lock/lock-service#getScriptLock\(\)), respectively. The old method names have been deprecated, but will continue to function. The new names follow the same conventions as `PropertiesService`.

Feature

- Added the `UiService` method [`DocsListDialog.setOAuthToken(oAuthToken)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/ui/docs-list-dialog#setOAuthToken\(String\)), which sets an OAuth 2.0 token to use when fetching data for the dialog, on behalf of the user whose content should be shown. This method will become mandatory before calling [`DocsListDialog.showDocsPicker()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/ui/docs-list-dialog#showDocsPicker\(\)) on September 30, 2014.
- Added the `CacheService` method [`getDocumentCache()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache/cache-service#getDocumentCache\(\)) and the `LockService` method [`getDocumentLock()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/lock/lock-service#getDocumentLock\(\)), which get a cache and a lock that all users can access within the current document, if the script is published as an add-on. These methods are conceptually similar to the `PropertiesService` method [`getDocumentProperties()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties-service#getDocumentProperties\(\)), which was introduced for use in add-ons earlier this year.

## September 02, 2014

**Gmail API**

v1

Feature

You can specify the `internalDateSource` for both the [`messages.insert`](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/insert) and [`messages.import`](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/import) methods.

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Change

**Reports API**: The maximum time limit for usage reports has been increased from 180 days to 450 days. Because this change will take time to populate in our data, the full 450 day history will be available on May 30, 2015 with an earliest available record date of March 6, 2014.

## August 15, 2014

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Feature

**Reports API**: A new [`view` event](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/activity-ref-appendix-a/drive-event-names#view_docs) has been added to the [Drive activity report](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/manage-audit-drive).

## August 11, 2014

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Deprecated

**Reseller API**: Deprecated `readonly` scope.

Change

**Reseller API**: new `licensedNumberOfSeats` field in the `Subscriptions` resource.

## July 17, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Feature

Added the value `ON_CHANGE` to the [`ScriptApp.EventType`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/event-type) enum so that Google Sheets [change events](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/understanding_events) can be detected correctly.

## July 11, 2014

**Gmail API**

v1

Change

Quota costs for all methods in the API have been reduced by a factor of 10. For example, if a method previously cost 150 quota units, it now costs 15. For a complete list of API method costs, see the [per-method quota usage chart](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/quota#per-method_quota_usage).

## June 25, 2014

**Gmail API**

v1

Announcement

The Gmail API is publicly available!

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Feature

**Reports API**: The [Drive activity report](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/manage-audit-drive) is now available. This new report provides insight about Drive activity and how your account's users manage, modify, and share their Google Drive documents. This report is available only for G Suite Business customers and replaces the Google Docs activity report. The Google Docs activity report is now deprecated and will cease functioning on January 31, 2015.

## June 20, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Deprecated

Deprecated the script gallery in the old version of Google Sheets. As explained in the [blog post](https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2014/06/deprecating-script-gallery-in-old.html), the add-on store in the new version of Sheets gives developers wider distribution, automatic updates, and several other features not available in the script gallery.

## June 05, 2014

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Change

**Reports API**: Both [customer](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/usage-ref-appendix-a/customers-gmail) and [user](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/usage-ref-appendix-a/users-gmail) Gmail reports now include default values. For example, if a user sends no email, the `num_emails_sent` parameter is returned as 0. Previously, if there was no data for a field, that field was omitted from the report.

## May 29, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Change

Added the `Document` service methods [`getTextAlignment`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/text#getTextAlignment\(\)) and [`setTextAlignment`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/text#setTextAlignment\(Integer,Integer,TextAlignment\)) as well as the enum `TextAlignment`, to support `NORMAL`, `SUPERSCRIPT`, and `SUBSCRIPT` text alignment in Google Docs.

## May 27, 2014

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Feature

**Reports API**: Includes usage statistics from suspended users in [Customers Usage reports](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/manage-usage-customers).

## May 15, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Deprecated

[Deprecated](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/support/sunset) both [`ScriptDB`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/script-db) and the [`Domain` service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/domain). As announced in the blog post, the services will remain available for the next six months but will be turned off on November 20, 2014. To replace `ScriptDB`, see the [migration guide](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/migration/script-db) and the improved guide to [connecting to external databases through JDBC](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/jdbc). To replace the `Domain service`, see the [Admin SDK Directory](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/admin-sdk-directory) and [Admin SDK Reports](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/admin-sdk-reports) advanced services.

Feature

Added a source property to the [event parameter](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/understanding_events) for [form triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/understanding_triggers). This makes it possible to retrieve the form that triggered the event.

Issue

- [Issue 3956](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3956): In the new version of Google Sheets, it is now possible to call methods that refer to the "active" sheet or spreadsheet even if the sheet or spreadsheet has just been created.
- [Issue 3579](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3579): The `Blob` method `getA` s can now create PDFs from spreadsheets created with the new version of Sheets.

Fixed

- [Issue 3963](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3963): The [Apps Script dashboard](https://script.google.com/dashboard) is available again.
- [Issue 3533](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3533): The `Trigger` methods `getEventType()` and `getTriggerSource()` no longer throw an exception if the trigger belongs to a spreadsheet created by the [new version of Google Sheets](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/3541068).

## April 24, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Change

In the [new version of Google Sheets](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/3541068), the Undo command can now revert changes made by a script. This was already true in Docs, Forms, and the older version of Sheets.

Fixed

- [Issue 3773](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3773): In the new version of Sheets, the Browser methods `inputBox` and `msgBox` now treat newline characters (`\n`) the same way that the older version of Sheets did. Specifically, `\n` produces a space, but `\\n` (double-escaped) produces a line break.
- [Issue 2335](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=2335): The fact that the ID of a `GmailThread` varies based on the messages it contains is [now documented](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/gmail/gmail-thread#getId\(\)).
- [Issue 2288](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=2288): The fact that a Google Site or page of a site cannot have more than 500 child pages is [now documented](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/sites/site#createAnnouncementsPage\(String,String,String\)).

## April 23, 2014

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Change

**Reports API**: A change has been made to how parameters with no data are returned by the API. Previously, if there was no data for a parameter, it would be absent from the report. For example, the Gmail user usage report would not include the `num_emails_sent` field in the response if a user didn't send any emails on the report date. The API now returns these parameters with a default of 0 for integers and false for boolean values.

## April 17, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Change

The `Document` method [`setSelection`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/document#setSelection\(Range\)), the `Sheet` method [`activate`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/sheet#activate\(\)), and the `Spreadsheet` methods [`setActiveRange`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet#setActiveRange\(Range\)) and [`setActiveSelection`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet#setActiveSelection\(Range\)) no longer have any effect if they are called from an [`onOpen` or `onEdit` trigger](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/understanding_triggers).

Issue

- [Issue 3669](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3669): In the [new version of Sheets](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/3541068), the `Range` methods `getValue()` and `getValues()` no longer throw an exception if a cell uses the built-in Sheets methods `=IMAGE(url)` or `=SPARKLINE(data)`.
- [Issue 2684](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=2684): If a script relies on a deleted version of a library, it is now possible to switch to a different version.

This new parameter indicates the number of domain users that have 2-step verification enforced but have not enrolled.

## April 10, 2014

**Google Apps Script**

Fixed

- [Issue 3788](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3788): In the new version of Sheets, custom functions now calculate if they are passed an error value as an argument. This matches the behavior in the older version of Sheets.
- [Issue 3539](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3539): In the new version of Sheets, the `Range` methods `setValue` and `setValues` now automatically detect when a value should be set as a formula. This matches the behavior in the older version of Sheets.

Deprecated

The deprecated SOAP service and old XML service have now been removed from autocomplete and documentation, as announced on July 9, 2013 and documented in the [Apps Script sunset schedule](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/support/sunset). Existing scripts that use these services should still function. The UI service widgets `DeckPanel`, `DecoratedPopupPanel`, `DockLayoutPanel`, `DockPanel`, `StackLayoutPanel`, and `TabLayoutPanel` have been completely disabled, as announced on April 15, 2013.

## April 03, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Feature

The Range method `getDataSourceUrl()` is now supported in the [new version of Google Sheets](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/3541068). For information on other incomplete Apps Script features in the new version of Sheets, see the [list of known issues](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/migration/sheets).

Change

- [Issue 3866](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3866): The `DocsList` methods `File.getEditors()` and `File.getViewers()` no longer throw a server error on every call.

- [Issue 3522](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3522): In the new version of Sheets, the `SpreadsheetApp` method `getActiveSheet()` now returns the correct sheet in a single custom function call. However, `getActiveSheet()` still returns an incorrect value if the custom function is used in more than one cell with the same function arguments, or if called from an installable edit trigger in the new version of Sheets.
- [Issue 3496](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3496): In the new version of Sheets, the `SpreadsheetApp` method `getActiveRange()` now returns the correct range in a single custom function call. However, `getActiveRange()` still returns an incorrect value if the custom function is used in more than one cell with the same function arguments, or if called from an installable edit trigger in the new version of Sheets.

## March 27, 2014

**Google Apps Script**

Fixed

- [Issue 3691](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3691): In the new version of Google Sheets, scripts can now run for 6 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
- [Issue 3236](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3236): Google Picker, a "file-open" dialog for information stored in Google servers, including files in Google Drive, is now [supported in HTML service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs#file-open_dialogs).

Change

When an [add-on](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview) is installed from the store, the `onInstall()` [simple trigger](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/understanding_triggers) is now passed an [event parameter](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/understanding_events), `e`, which includes an `authMode` property. This makes it easier for an add-on to [call `onOpen(e)` from `onInstall(e)`](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/addon-authorization#the_complete_lifecycle).

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Fixed

**Reports API**: Fixed an issue that caused filters to use case-sensitive comparisons. All filters are now case-insensitive.

Feature

**Reports API**: Added two new `login_failure_type` values to the [Login Audit events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/activity-ref-appendix-a/login-event-names): `login_failure_account_disabled` and `login_failure_unknown`.

## March 24, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Change

In the [new version of Google Sheets](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/3541068), `Range.setValues()` now automatically extends the spreadsheet if the range is larger than the present size.

Fixed

- [Issue 3800](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3800): In the new version of Sheets, custom functions now accept numbers larger than 10,000,000 or smaller than 0.0001 as arguments.

[Issue 3757](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3757): The link to the Google Developers Console in the Advanced Google Services dialog now opens the correct project.

## March 11, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Announcement

[Announced a developer preview](https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2014/03/add-ons.html) for add-ons in Google Docs and the new version of Google Sheets, with support for Google Forms coming soon. An add-on is an Apps Script project published to a store inside Docs or Sheets, which makes it easy for users to find and install new features. Our guides cover everything you need to know to [develop](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview), [design](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/guides/style), and [apply to publish](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/publish-addons) your first add-on.

Feature

- Released a [CSS package](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/guides/css) to apply Google styling to fonts, buttons, and form elements in HTML service dialogs and sidebars, primarily for use in add-ons.
- Added the UI method [`createAddonMenu()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#createAddonMenu\(\)), which allows scripts to insert a sub-menu into the Add-ons menu in Google Sheets or Docs. For more information, see the [guide to menus](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/menus).
- Added the `ScriptApp` enum [`AuthMode`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/auth-mode), which identifies categories of authorized services that Apps Script can execute through a triggered function. For more information, see the [guide to the add-on authorization lifecycle](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/addon-authorization#authorization_modes).
- Added support for the custom JsDoc annotation [`@OnlyCurrentDoc`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/authorization#manual_authorization_scopes_for_sheets_docs_and_forms), which forces the authorization dialog to ask only for access to files in which an add-on or script is used, rather than all of a user's spreadsheets, documents, or forms. An opposing annotation, `@NotOnlyCurrentDoc`, is also available.

Change

Changed the [quota](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas) for Gmail from 10,000 reads and 10,000 writes per day (excluding sent messages) to 20,000 reads and writes combined per day.

## March 05, 2014

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Fixed

**Reports API**: Fixed an issue that caused filters to be ignored on queries for single users and always return a single record. After the fix, queries for single users that also include filters will return no result if the user does not match the filter criteria.

## February 28, 2014

**Google Workspace Admin SDK**

Fixed

**Reports API**: Fixed an issue that caused certain statistics on numbers of active users to include one extra day. Some domains might notice a decrease in the number of reported active users for reports after February 24, 2014. The affected fields are:

- Accounts
	- `num_1day_logins`
		- `num_7day_logins`
		- `num_30day_logins`
- Google Calendar
	- `num_1day_active_users`
		- `num_7day_active_users`
- Google Docs
	- `num_1day_active_users`
		- `num_7day_active_users`
		- `num_30day_active_users`
- Gmail
	- `num_1day_active_users`
		- `num_7day_active_users`
		- `num_30day_active_users`
- Google+
	- `num_1day_active_users`

## February 25, 2014

**Google Apps Script**

Change

- Replaced `ScriptProperties` and `UserProperties` with a unified [`PropertiesService`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties-service). For more information, see the [guide to the Properties service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/properties).
- In Google Docs and Forms, sidebars now ignore the `setWidth()` method; they cannot be changed from the default width of 300px. This change was applied to the new version of Sheets in the previous week's release.
- In Google Docs and Forms, the Undo command can now revert changes made by a script. This is also true in the older version of Sheets, but not the new version.
- In the HTML service, the [`NATIVE` sandbox mode](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/restrictions#sandbox_mode) is now the default if you have not specified which mode your script should use. In a few edge cases, this may affect how existing web apps operate; if so, append [`.setSandboxMode(HtmlService.SandboxMode.EMULATED)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/html/html-output#setSandboxMode\(SandboxMode\)) to your `HtmlOutput` object to restore the old behavior.

Fixed

[Issue 3622](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3622): The title bar of a sidebar shown by a script in Google Docs, Forms, or the new version of Sheets is now the same height as in a sidebar shown by a built-in feature.

Deprecated

[Deprecated](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/support/sunset) the [Finance service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/finance). As announced in the [blog post](https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2014/02/more-apps-script-apis-and-features.html), the service will remain available for the next six months but will be turned off on September 26, 2014.

Feature

- Added the following `DocumentApp` classes and methods, which allow scripts to create bookmarks and named ranges, plus set the user's cursor position or selection.
	- `Bookmark`
		- \`NamedRange
		- \`RangeBuilder
		- \`Document.addBookmark(position)
		- \`Document.addNamedRange(name, range)
		- \`Document.getBookmark(id)
		- \`Document.getBookmarks()
		- \`Document.getNamedRangeById(id)
		- \`Document.getNamedRanges()
		- \`Document.getNamedRanges(name)
		- \`Document.newPosition(element, offset)
		- \`Document.newRange()
		- \`Document.setCursor(position)
		- \`Document.setSelection(range)
		- \`Position.insertBookmark()
- Added the following `ScriptApp` class and methods, which allow scripts to create state tokens that can be used in callback APIs (like OAuth flows), as well as to retrieve the script's own OAuth 2.0 access token.
	- \`StateTokenBuilder
		- \`ScriptApp.getOAuthToken()
		- \`ScriptApp.newStateToken()
- Added the method `showModalDialog(userInterface, title)` to the Ui class, and replaced the method `showDialog(userInterface)` with `showModelessDialog(userInterface, title)`. This allows scripts to specify whether a dialog in Google Docs, Forms, or the new version of Sheets should prevent the user from interacting with anything other than the dialog.
- Added the client-side HTML-service method `google.script.host.editor.focus()`, which allows scripts to switch browser focus from the dialog or sidebar to the Google Docs, Sheets, or Forms editor.

## February 24, 2014

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Change

**Directory API**: The [`users.update` method](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/users/update) behavior has been slightly changed to accommodate delegated administrator access to the Directory API. Only fields the authenticated user has access to can be specified in the request and only fields that have been updated are included in the response.

## February 18, 2014

**Google Apps Script**

Fixed

- [Issue 3522](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3522): In the new version of Sheets, the `SpreadsheetApp` method `getActiveSheet()` now returns the correct sheet if called from a `simple onEdit()` trigger. However, `getActiveSheet()` still returns an incorrect value if used in a custom function or an installable edit trigger in the new version of Sheets.
- [Issue 3496](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3496): In the new version of Sheets, the `SpreadsheetApp` method `getActiveRange()` now returns the correct sheet if called from a simple `onEdit()` trigger. However, `getActiveRange()` still returns an incorrect value if used in a custom function or an installable edit trigger in the new version of Sheets.
- [Issue 3332](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3332): The `DocumentApp` method `setHeading()` now applies heading styles in the same way that the Google Docs editor does.

Deprecated

Removed the Session method `getActiveUserTimeZone()`, which did not return a value for most users.

Change

- In Google Docs, Forms, and the [new version of Sheets](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/3541068), showing a dialog now automatically closes any other dialogs opened by a script. This matches the longstanding behavior in the older version of Sheets.
- In the new version of Sheets, sidebars now ignore the `setWidth()` method; they cannot be changed from the default width of 300px. This change will affect Docs and Forms soon.

## February 10, 2014

**Google Workspace Admin SDK**

Feature

**Reports API**: Suspended users are now included in the statistics for Google Docs reports. Some domains might notice an increase in the number of reported documents. The following parameters have been added to the User's usage report:

- [Accounts](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/usage-ref-appendix-a/users-accounts): `used_quota_in_percentage`
- [Docs](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/usage-ref-appendix-a/users-docs)
	- `num_docs_externally_visible`
		- `num_docs_internally_visible`
- [Gmail](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/usage-ref-appendix-a/users-gmail): `num_emails_exchanged`

## January 27, 2014

**Google Apps Script**

Deprecated

Renamed several classes and methods in `DocumentApp`. The old names are deprecated but will continue to work. You do not need to update your code.

- `SearchResult` and `SelectedElement` are now `RangeElement`.
- `Selection` is now `Range`.
- `Selection.getSelectedElements()` is now `Range.getRangeElements()`.

Change

The [quota](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas) for the number of email recipients for scripts running from consumer (gmail.com) or free Google Apps accounts has been reduced from 500 to 100 per day. The quota for paid Google Apps accounts has not been changed.

Feature

Added the following `Session` methods, which allow scripts to determine the user's locale and time zone:

- `getActiveUserLocale()`
- `getActiveUserTimeZone()`

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Feature

**Directory API**: Supports [push notifications](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/push) for changes to users and aliases. You no longer need to poll resources to detect changes. You can create a notification channel using the [`users.watch`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users/watch) and [`users.aliases.watch`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/users/aliases/watch) methods. You can stop receiving notifications with the [`channels.stop`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/channels/stop) method.

Feature

**Reports API**: Added [push notifications](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/push) for changes to the [`Activities` resource](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/activities). This is exposed in the API as two new methods, [`activities.watch`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/activities/watch) and [`channels.stop`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/channels/stop), to start and stop receiving notifications.

Feature

**Directory API**: Structured search queries for users are available by using the [`users.list` method](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/users/list).

## January 21, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Feature

The new `SpreadsheetApp` method `Spreadsheet.getUi()` allows scripts to access the spreadsheet's user-interface environment in order to add features like menus, dialogs, and sidebars. This method is consistent with the `getUi()` methods in `DocumentApp` and `FormApp`, but only works in the new version of Google Sheets. The older version of Google Sheets continues to use the existing methods documented in the guides to dialogs and sidebars and menus.

## January 13, 2014

**Google Apps Script** Deprecated

Deprecated the `SpreadsheetApp.Spreadsheet` methods `isAnonymousView()`, `isAnonymousWrite()`, `isReadable()`, `isWritable()`, and `setAnonymousAccess()`. Various methods of the [`File`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/drive/file) class in `DriveApp` can achieve the same functionality.

Change

Renamed the `Cursor` object in `DocumentApp` to `Position`. This does not require any changes to existing code.

Feature

Added the `SpreadsheetApp` method `DataValidationBuilder.requireFormulaSatisfied(String)`, as well as an accompanying `CUSTOM_FORMULA` value in `DataValidationCriteria`. This feature can only be used in the new version of Google Sheets.

## January 06, 2014

**Google Apps Script**

Change

- Custom menus in Google Docs now appear in the Help menu search box.
- Custom dialogs created with the HTML service can now be [resized](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/communication#resizing_dialogs_in_google_apps) by calling `google.script.host.setWidth(width)` and `google.script.host.setHeight(height)` in client-side code. Sidebars cannot be resized in client side code.

Feature

Added the advanced parameter escaping to [`UrlFetchApp.fetch()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app#fetch\(String,Object\)). If `false`, reserved characters in the URL will not be automatically escaped.

Feature

The `Maps.DirectionFinder.Mode` enum now includes the `TRANSIT` value allowing for the retrieval of public transit routes in the [`Maps` service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/maps).

## December 16, 2013

**Google Apps Script** Fixed

[Issue 3461](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3461): A yellow warning bar should no longer appear on Apps Script gadgets that are embedded in Google Sites.

Change

- [Changed the default syntax](http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/12/more-google-services-available-in-apps.html) for all existing advanced services to match the underlying APIs' reference documentation. The old Apps Script getter/setter notation for these services will continue to work but will no longer appear in autocomplete.
- Renamed the menu entry **Resources > Manage libraries** to **Resources > Libraries**.
- Renamed the menu entry **Resources > Google APIs Services** to **Resources > Advanced Google services**.

Feature

[Added seven new advanced services](http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/12/more-google-services-available-in-apps.html): + Admin SDK Directory service + Admin SDK Reports service + Fusion Tables service + Google+ Domains service + Mirror service + YouTube service + YouTube Analytics service

## December 03, 2013

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Feature

**Reports API**: Added support for resellers to retrieve usage reports and audit information for a specific customer. This is exposed in the API as a new `customerId` parameter for the [`activities.list`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/activities/list), [`customerUsageReports.get`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/customerUsageReports/get), and [`userUsageReport.get`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/reference/userUsageReport/get) methods.

## December 02, 2013

**Google Apps Script**

Fixed

- [Issue 3101](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3101): Removed the `SitesApp` method `Site.deleteSite()`, which was never functional.
- [Issue 3046](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3046): `UrlFetchApp` now properly preserves RFC 3986 escaping.

- [`Folder.getOwner()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/drive/folder#getOwner\(\))

## September 16, 2013

**Google Apps Script**

Feature

- HTML Service now supports most CSS3 features. A notable exception is the `:nth-child()` pseudo-selector, which remains unsupported, along with a small number of obscure or non-standardized CSS3 features. To check whether the Caja security sandbox in HTML Service supports a specific feature, see the [CSS whitelist definitions in Caja's public repository](https://code.google.com/p/google-caja/source/browse/trunk/src/com/google/caja/lang/css).
- Added the following `DriveApp` methods, which allow scripts to save the state of a file or folder iterator and resume at a later time. These method are useful if processing an iterator in one execution would exceed the maximum execution time.
	- `FileIterator.getContinuationToken()`
		- `FolderIterator.getContinuationToken()`
		- `DriveApp.continueFileIterator(continuationToken)`
		- `DriveApp.continueFolderIterator(continuationToken)`

Deprecated

The `UiApp` widgets `Hyperlink`, `InlineHyperlink`, `LayoutPanel`, and `RichTextArea` have now been disabled, as announced on March 13, 2013 and documented in the [Apps Script sunset schedule](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/support/sunset).

## September 09, 2013

**Google Apps Script** Deprecated

Deprecated the `DocumentApp` methods `getFootnotes()`, `getLinkUrl()`, `setLinkUrl(url)`, and `isAtDocumentEnd()` in the classes `FooterSection`, `FootnoteSection`, and `HeaderSection`, as well as the methods `getNextSibling()` and `getPreviousSibling()` in the classes `FooterSection` and `HeaderSection`. These methods were not useful.

Fixed

Feature

Added the `DocumentApp` methods [`InlineImage.getLinkUrl()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/inline-image#getLinkUrl\(\)) and [`InlineImage.setLinkUrl(url)`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/inline-image#setLinkUrl\(String\)).

## September 03, 2013

**Google Apps Script**

Feature

- Added the `DriveApp` methods `DriveApp.getFoldersByName(name)` and `DriveApp.searchFolders(params)`, which return a `FolderIterator` with the requested results.
- Added the `DriveApp` methods `File.getViewers()`, `File.getEditors()`, `Folder.getViewers()`, and `Folder.getEditors()`, which return an array of `Users` with view or edit access.

Deprecated

Removed the ability to get the user's email address in [simple `onEdit()` triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/understanding_triggers#simple-triggers). Because simple triggers don't request user authentication, this change was important to protect the identity of collaborators who hadn't explicitly granted permission for the script to collect their email address.

## September 02, 2013

**Google Workspace Admin SDK** Feature

- Scripts now always require authorization to use the methods `Session.getEffectiveUser()` or `Session.getUser()`. Existing scripts that use those methods and were upgraded to the new authorization experience require reauthorization but will not prompt for authorization automatically. To reauthorize the script, [follow these instructions](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/scripts_google_accounts#reauth).
- `UrlFetch` requests made by scripts that run on a time-based trigger now include an `If-Modified-Since` HTTP header so that Apps Script can use a cached copy of the page if one is available and the page has not changed.

## June 17, 2013

**Google Apps Script**

Fixed

- [Issue 2626](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=2626): The execution transcript now correctly reports the execution time for methods that are called repeatedly.

**Google Workspace Admin SDK**

Breaking

**Directory API**: The differences between the Directory API and the deprecated Provisioning API (v2):

- Account's domain name
	- The Directory API user's `primaryEmail` property holds the account's primary domain name.
		- The Provisioning API request URL's `domain` property holds the account's primary domain name.
- Administrator
	- The Directory API `isAdmin` property has a boolean `true`, `false` value. The `isAdmin` property can only be edited in the `Make a user an administrator` operation. If edited in the `Create a user account` or `Update a user account` operations, the edit is ignored.
		- The Provisioning API `isAdmin` property has a boolean `true`, `false` value. The property can be edited when the user is created or updated.
- A `customerId` unique identifier
	- The Directory API returns a `customerId` unique identifier property when a user is retrieved for an account with a single or multiple organizational units.
		- The Provisioning API returns a `customerId` for accounts with an organizational unit hierarchy.
- Deleted user list
	- The Directory API returns a list of users deleted from the account or a subdomain within the span of the last 20 days.
		- The Provisioning API doesn't support this feature.
- Disk space
	- Not applicable in this version of the Directory API.
		- The Provisioning API `apps:quota` that sets the user's disk space quota is no longer available. Setting a customer quota, different than 25600MB, has no effect.
- Devices
	- The Directory API's Google Chrome devices and mobile devices support the management of retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting your account's various devices.
		- The Provisioning API doesn't support these features.
- Email aliases outside of an account
	- The Directory API users and groups support listing non-editable alias email addresses that are outside of the account. These are functioning email addresses used by a user or a group on a regular basis.
		- The Provisioning API doesn't support this feature.
- Group alias
	- The Directory API creates, lists, and deletes a group's aliases.
		- The Provisioning API supports managing groups but doesn't include group aliases.
- Hash function
	- The Directory API `hashFunction` property holds the hash format of the `password` property. The values can be set to either SHA-1, MD5, or CRYPT hash formats.
		- The Provisioning API `hashFunctionName` attribute is a part of the `password` tag. The values can be either SHA-1, MD5, or CRYPT hash formats.
- Organizational units
	- The Directory API uses the `orgUnitPath` property when setting a new user.
		- The Provisioning API has two steps for creating a user in an organizational unit. First the user account is created and then the user is assigned to an organizational unit.
- Suspend a user
	- The Directory API suspends a user's account either when creating or updating the user's account using the `suspended` property. The reason for the suspension is also retained by the API in the `suspensionReason` property.
		- The Provisioning API uses the operation that suspends a user's account.
- Undelete a user
	- The Directory API undeletes a previously deleted user account within 20 days of the deletion.
		- The Provisioning API restores a suspended user account to an active state within the suspension period.
- User aliases
	- The Directory API supports user alias for a single or multiple domain account. A user alias is an alternate email address that uses the same mailbox used by the user's primary email address. A user's alias can be associated with a different account domain than that domain used by the user's primary email address. The account can have single or multiple domains. The Directory API doesn't use the concept of a 'nickname' for a single domain.
		- The Provisioning API manages a single domain account's nicknames, and, in the case of an account with multiple domains, the Provisioning API supports user aliases.
- User list's search, sorting, and list order
	- The Directory API can search for users by primary email address, given name, or family name. In addition, the Directory API can return lists of a domain's users sorted by the user's primary email address, given name, or family name. And, you have the option to list these results in ascending or descending order.
		- The Provisioning API doesn't support these features.

## June 18, 2012

**Google Apps Script**

Change

- The Script Editor's user interface has been updated.
- **Publish > Publish as service** is now **Publish > Deploy as web app**. Additionally, for new scripts, before you can deploy them as a web app, you must first save a version of the script. You can then choose which version should be served when the script is deployed as a web app. For existing scripts that were already published as a service, you will still be able to access the published URL from the **Deploy as web app** dialog, but to make additional changes, you will need to save a version of the script.

## June 08, 2012

**Google Apps Script** Change

Simplified sharing settings for scripts. For new script projects, the script will inherit the permissions of its parent. For example, if a script is associated with a Spreadsheet, and user1@example.com has edit access to the Spreadsheet, then user1@example.com will have edit access to the script. The extra blue Share button will no longer be present on these newly created scripts, since the permissions are tied to those of the parent. For scripts created prior to June 8, 2012, the Share button will remain if the checkbox to "Allow document collaborators to edit project" or "Allow site collaborators and owners to edit project" was not selected for that script. For more information see [Security](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guide_security). If you would like to have script source that cannot be modified by the editors of your Spreadsheet or Site, then you can use [Script Libraries](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/libraries).
