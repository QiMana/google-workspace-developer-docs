# Method: users.settings.cse.identities.create

Creates and configures a client-side encryption identity that's authorized to send mail from the user account. Google publishes the S/MIME certificate to a shared domain-wide directory so that people within a Google Workspace organization can encrypt and send mail to the identity.

For administrators managing identities and keypairs for users in their organization, requests require authorization with a [service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount) that has [domain-wide delegation authority](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority) to impersonate users with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic` scope.

For users managing their own identities and keypairs, requests require [hardware key encryption](https://support.google.com/a/answer/14153163) turned on and configured.
