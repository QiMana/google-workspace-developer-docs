# Usage limits

The Gmail API is subject to usage limits which restrict the rate at which methods of the API can be called. Limits are defined in terms of [quota units](#per-method-quota), an abstract unit of measurement representing Gmail resource usage. There are two usage limits which are applied simultaneously: a per project rate limit and a per user rate limit.

The following table details these limits:

| Usage limit type | Limit | Error code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per project rate limit | 1,200,000 quota units per minute | [`rateLimitExceeded`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides/handle-errors#rate-limit) |
| Per user rate limit | 15,000 quota units per minute per user | [`userRateLimitExceeded`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides/handle-errors#user-rate-limit) |

For information on handling limit errors, see [Resolve errors](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides/handle-errors).

## Per-method quota usage

The number of quota units consumed by a request varies depending on the method called. The following table outlines the per-method quota unit usage:

| Method | Quota units |
| --- | --- |
| `drafts.create` | 10 |
| `drafts.delete` | 10 |
| `drafts.get` | 5 |
| `drafts.list` | 5 |
| `drafts.send` | 100 |
| `drafts.update` | 15 |
| `getProfile` | 1 |
| `history.list` | 2 |
| `labels.create` | 5 |
| `labels.delete` | 5 |
| `labels.get` | 1 |
| `labels.list` | 1 |
| `labels.update` | 5 |
| `messages.attachments.get` | 5 |

When using the Gmail API, there's also a limit of 500 recipients per email message.

## Resolve time-based quota errors

For all time-based errors (maximum of N requests per X minutes), we recommend your code catches the exception and uses a *truncated exponential backoff* to make sure your devices don't generate excessive load.

Exponential backoff is a standard error handling strategy for network applications. An exponential backoff algorithm retries requests using exponentially increasing wait times between requests, up to a maximum backoff time. If requests are still unsuccessful, it's important that the delays between requests increase over time until the request is successful.

### Example algorithm

An exponential backoff algorithm retries requests exponentially, increasing the wait time between retries up to a maximum backoff time. For example:

1. Make a request to Gmail API.
2. If the request fails, wait 1 + `random_number_milliseconds` and retry the request.
3. If the request fails, wait 2 + `random_number_milliseconds` and retry the request.
4. If the request fails, wait 4 + `random_number_milliseconds` and retry the request.
5. And so on, up to a `maximum_backoff` time.
6. Continue waiting and retrying up to some maximum number of retries, but don't increase the wait period between retries.

where:

- The wait time is `min(((2^n)+random_number_milliseconds), maximum_backoff)`, with `n` incremented by 1 for each iteration (request).
- `random_number_milliseconds` is a random number of milliseconds less than or equal to 1,000. This helps to avoid cases in which many clients are synchronized by some situation and all retry at once, sending requests in synchronized waves. The value of `random_number_milliseconds` is recalculated after each retry request.
- `maximum_backoff` is typically 32 or 64 seconds. The appropriate value depends on the use case.

The client can continue retrying after it has reached the `maximum_backoff` time. Retries after this point don't need to continue increasing backoff time. For example, if a client uses a `maximum_backoff` time of 64 seconds, then after reaching this value, the client can retry every 64 seconds. At some point, clients should be prevented from retrying indefinitely.

The wait time between retries and the number of retries depend on your use case and network conditions.

## Pricing

All use of the Gmail API is available at no additional cost. Exceeding the quota request limits doesn't incur extra charges and your account is not billed.

## Request a quota increase

Depending on your project's resource usage, you might want to request a quota adjustment. API calls by a service account are considered to be using a single account. Applying for an adjusted quota doesn't guarantee approval. Quota adjustment requests that would significantly increase the quota value can take longer to be approved.

Not all projects have the same quotas. As you increasingly use Google Cloud over time, your quota values might need to increase. If you expect a notable upcoming increase in usage, you can proactively [request quota adjustments](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quota#requesting_higher_quota) from the [Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) in the Google Cloud console.
