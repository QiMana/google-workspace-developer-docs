# Create a Google Cloud project

## Page Summary

- A Google Cloud project is a prerequisite for utilizing Google Workspace APIs and developing Google Workspace add-ons or applications.
- You can create a new Cloud project through the Google Cloud console or the gcloud command-line interface, providing a foundation for your Google Workspace integrations.
- Depending on your usage of Google Workspace APIs, enabling billing for your Cloud project might be necessary to access certain features and services.
- After creating your Cloud project, the next crucial step is to enable the specific Google Workspace APIs that your application or add-on will interact with.

A Google Cloud project is required to use Google Workspace APIs and build Google Workspace add-ons or apps. A Cloud project forms the basis for creating, enabling, and using all Google Cloud services, including managing APIs, enabling billing, adding and removing collaborators, and managing permissions.

## Create a Cloud project

### Google Cloud console

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to Menu \> **IAM & Admin** \> **Create a Project**.
	[Go to Create a Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
2. In the **Project Name** field, enter a descriptive name for your project.
	Optional: To edit the **Project ID**, click **Edit**. The project ID can't be changed after the project is created, so choose an ID that meets your needs for the lifetime of the project.
3. In the **Location** field, click **Browse** to display potential locations for your project. Then, click **Select**.
4. Click **Create**. The Google Cloud console navigates to the Dashboard page and your project is created within a few minutes.

### gcloud CLI

In one of the following development environments, access the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`):

- **Cloud Shell**: To use an online terminal with the gcloud CLI already set up, activate Cloud Shell.  
	[Activate Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true)
- **Local Shell**: To use a local development environment, [install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and [initialize](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI.  
	To create a Cloud project, use the `gcloud projects create` command:
	```
	gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
	```
	Replace PROJECT\_ID by setting the ID for the project you want to create.

For further information on Cloud projects, refer to [Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) in the Google Cloud documentation.

## Optional: Enable billing for your Cloud project

Depending on the Google Workspace APIs and features that you want to use, you might also need to enable billing for your Cloud project:

### Google Cloud console

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to **Billing**. Click **Menu** \> **Billing** \> **My Projects**.
	[Go to Billing for My Projects](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/projects)
2. In **Select an organization**, choose the organization associated with your Google Cloud project.
3. In the project row, open the **Actions** menu (), click **Change billing**, and choose the Cloud Billing account.
4. Click **Set account**.

### gcloud CLI

1. To list available billing accounts, run:
	```
	gcloud billing accounts list
	```
2. Link a billing account with a Google Cloud project:
	```
	gcloud billing projects link PROJECT_ID --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
	```
	Replace the following:
	- `PROJECT_ID` is the **Project ID** for the Cloud project for which you want to enable billing.
		- `BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID` is the **billing account ID** to link with the Google Cloud project.

For further information about billing, see [Enable, disable, or change billing for a project](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) in the Google Cloud Billing documentation.
