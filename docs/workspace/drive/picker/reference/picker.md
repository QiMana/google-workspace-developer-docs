# Resource summary for Google Picker API

The Google Picker API uses a builder pattern with [`PickerBuilder`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/picker/reference/picker.pickerbuilder) and [`Picker`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/picker/reference/picker.picker).

```
const picker = new google.picker.PickerBuilder()
    .setOAuthtoken('TOKEN_FOR_USER')
    .setAppId('1234567890')  // Cloud Project number
    .addView(google.picker.ViewId.DOCS)
    .setCallback((data) => {
      console.log(data);
    })
    .build();

picker.setVisible(true);
```
