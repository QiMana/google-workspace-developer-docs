# Manage pending access proposals

An *access proposal* is a proposal from a requester to an approver to grant a recipient access to a Google Drive item.

An approver can review and act on all unresolved access proposals across Drive files. This means you can speed up the approval process by programmatically querying for access proposals and then resolving them. It also allows proposals to be viewed in aggregate by an approver.

The Google Drive API provides the [`accessproposals`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/accessproposals) resource so you can view and resolve pending access proposals. The methods of the `accessproposals` resource work on files, folders, the files within a shared drive but *not* on the shared drive.

The following terms are specific to access proposals:

- **Requester**: The user initiating the access proposal to a Drive item.
- **Recipient**: The user receiving the additional permissions on a file if the access proposal is granted. Many times the recipient is the same as the requester but not always.
- **Approver**: The user responsible for approving (or denying) the access proposal. This is typically because they're an owner on the document or they have the ability to share the document.

## Use the fields parameter

If you want to specify the fields to return in the response, you can set the `fields` [system parameter](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/system-parameters#definitions) with any method of the `accessproposals` resource. If you omit the `fields` parameter, the server returns a default set of fields specific to the method. To return different fields, see [Return specific fields](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/fields-parameter).

## Get a pending access proposal

To get an access proposal, use the [`get`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/accessproposals/get) method on the [`accessproposals`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/accessproposals) resource with the `fileId` and `proposalId` path parameters. If you don't know the proposal ID, you can [list pending access proposals](#list-access-proposals) using the `list` method.

## List pending access proposals

To list all pending access proposals on a Drive item, call the [`list`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/accessproposals/list) method on the [`accessproposals`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/accessproposals) resource and include the `fileId` path parameter.

Only approvers on a file can list the pending proposals on a file. An approver is a user with the `can_approve_access_proposals` capability on the file. If the requester isn't an approver, an empty list is returned. For more information about `capabilities`, see [Understand file capabilities](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-sharing#capabilities).

The [response body](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/accessproposals/list#response-body) consists of an `accessproposals` object representing a list of unresolved access proposals on the file.

The `accessproposals` object includes info about each proposal such as the requester, the recipient, and the message that the requester added. It also includes a [`RoleAndView`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/accessproposals#roleandview) object that groups the requester's proposed `role` with a `view`. Since `role` is a repeated field, multiples could exist for each proposal. For example, a proposal might have an `RoleAndView` object of `role=reader` and `view=published`, plus an additional `RoleAndView` object with only the `role=writer` value. For more information, see [Views](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/ref-roles#views).

Pass the following query parameters to customize pagination of, or filter, access proposals:

- `pageToken`: A page token, received from a previous list call. Provide this token to retrieve the subsequent page.
- `pageSize`: The maximum number of access proposals to return per page.

## Resolve pending access proposals

To resolve all pending access proposals on a Drive item, call the [`resolve`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/accessproposals/resolve) method on the [`accessproposals`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/accessproposals) resource and include the `fileId` and `proposalId` path parameters.

The `resolve` method includes an `action` query parameter that denotes the action to take on the proposal. The [`Action`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/accessproposals/resolve#action) object tracks the state change of the proposal so we know if it's being accepted or denied.

The `resolve` method also includes the optional query parameters of `role` and `view`. The only supported roles are `writer`, `commenter`, and `reader`. If the role isn't specified, it defaults to `reader`. For more information, see [Roles and permissions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/ref-roles). An additional optional query parameter of `sendNotification` lets you send an email notification to the requester when the proposal is accepted or denied.

Just as with the `list` method, users resolving the proposal must have the `can_approve_access_proposals` capability on the file. For more information about `capabilities`, see [Understand file capabilities](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-sharing#capabilities).

Proposals are resolved using the same patterns listed under [Scenarios for sharing Drive resources](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-sharing#sharing-drive-resources). If there are multiple proposals for the same user, but with different roles, the following applies:

- If one proposal is accepted and one is denied, the accepted role applies to the Drive item.
- If both proposals are accepted at the same time, the proposal with the higher permission (for example, `role=writer` versus `role=reader`) is applied. The other access proposal is removed from the item.

After sending a proposal to the `resolve` method, the sharing action is complete. The resolved access proposal is no longer returned through the `list` method. Once the proposal is accepted, the user must use the [`permissions`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/permissions) resource to update permissions on a file or folder. For more information, see [Update permissions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-sharing#update-permissions).
