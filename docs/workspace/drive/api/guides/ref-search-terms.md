# Search query terms and operators

This reference guide provides query terms and operators you can use with the Google Drive API to filter for files, folders, and shared drives.

For file search examples, see [Search for files and folders](./search-files.md).

For example searches of shared drives, see [Search for shared drives](./search-shareddrives.md).

## Query string syntax

A query string contains the following three parts:

*`query_term operator values`*

Where:

- *`query_term`* is the query term or field to search upon.
- *`operator`* specifies the condition for the query term.
- *`values`* are the specific values you want to use to filter your search results.

## Query operators

The following table lists the valid query operators:

| Operator | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `contains` | The content of one string is present in the other. |
| `=` | The content of a string or boolean is equal to the other. |
| `!=` | The content of a string or boolean is not equal to the other. |
| `<` | A value is less than another. |
| `<=` | A value is less than or equal to another. |
| `>` | A value is greater than another. |
| `>=` | A value is greater than or equal to another. |
| `in` | An element is contained within a collection. |
| `and` | Return items that match both queries. |
| `or` | Return items that match either query. |
| `not` | Negates a search query. |
| `has` | A collection contains an element matching the parameters. |

## File-specific query terms

The following table lists all valid file query terms. For data types and descriptions, refer to the [`files`](../reference/rest/v3/files.md) resource reference.

| Query term | Valid operators | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `contains`, `=`, `!=` | Name of the file. Surround with single quotes (`'`). Escape single quotes in queries with `\'`, such as `'Valentine\'s Day'`. |
| `fullText` | `contains` | Whether the `name`, `description`, [`indexableText`](./file-metadata.md#indexable-text) properties, or text in the file's content or metadata of the file matches. Surround with single quotes (`'`). Escape single quotes in queries with `\'`, such as `'Valentine\'s Day'`. |
| `mimeType` | `contains`, `=`, `!=` | MIME type of the file. Surround with single quotes (`'`). Escape single quotes in queries with `\'`, such as `'Valentine\'s Day'`. For further information on MIME types, see [Google Workspace and Google Drive supported MIME types](./mime-types.md). |
| `modifiedTime` | `<=`, `<`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=` | Date of the last file modification. [RFC 3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format, default time zone is UTC, such as `2012-06-04T12:00:00-08:00`. Fields of type `date` are not comparable to each other, only to constant dates. |
| `viewedByMeTime` | `<=`, `<`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=` | Date that the user last viewed a file. [RFC 3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format, default time zone is UTC, such as `2012-06-04T12:00:00-08:00`. Fields of type `date` are not comparable to each other, only to constant dates. |
| `trashed` | `=`, `!=` | Whether the file is in the trash or not. Can be either `true` or `false`. |
| `starred` | `=`, `!=` | Whether the file is starred or not. Can be either `true` or `false`. |
| `parents` | `in` | Whether the parents collection contains the specified ID. |
| `owners` | `in` | Users who own the file. |
| `writers` | `in` | Users or groups who have permission to modify the file. See the [`permissions`](../reference/rest/v3/permissions.md) resource reference. |
| `readers` | `in` | Users or groups who have permission to read the file. See the [`permissions`](../reference/rest/v3/permissions.md) resource reference. |
| `sharedWithMe` | `=`, `!=` | Files that are in the user's ["Shared with me" collection](./about-files.md#corpora). All file users are in the file's Access Control List (ACL). Can be either `true` or `false`. |
| `createdTime` | `<=`, `<`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=` | Date when the file was created. Use [RFC 3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format, default time zone is UTC, such as `2012-06-04T12:00:00-08:00`. Supported in Drive API v3 only. |
| `properties` | `has` | Public custom file properties. |
| `appProperties` | `has` | Private custom file properties. |
| `visibility` | `=`, `!=` | The visibility level of the file. Valid values are `anyoneCanFind`, `anyoneWithLink`, `domainCanFind`, `domainWithLink`, and `limited`. Surround with single quotes (`'`). |
| `shortcutDetails.targetId` | `=`, `!=` | The ID of the item the shortcut points to. |

The following demonstrates operator and query term combinations:

- The `contains` operator only performs prefix matching for a `name` term. For example, suppose you have a name of `HelloWorld`. A query of `name contains 'Hello'` returns a result, but a query of `name contains 'World'` doesn't.
- The `contains` operator only performs matching on entire string tokens for the `fullText` term. For example, if the full text of a document contains the string "HelloWorld", only the query `fullText contains 'HelloWorld'` returns a result.
- The `contains` operator matches a phrase if the right operand is surrounded by double quotes. For example:
	- If the `fullText` of a document contains the string "Hello there world", then the query `fullText contains '"Hello there"'` returns a result, but the query `fullText contains '"Hello world"'` doesn't.
		- If the full text of a document contains the string "Hello\_world", then the query `fullText contains '"Hello world"'` still returns a result as the underscore in the document string is treated as a space.
- The `owners`, `writers`, and `readers` terms are indirectly reflected in the [`permissions`](../reference/rest/v3/permissions.md) list and refer to the `role` on the permission. For a complete list of role permissions, see [Roles and permissions](./ref-roles.md).

## Shared drive-specific query terms

The following table lists all valid shared drive query terms. For data types and descriptions, see the [`drives`](../reference/rest/v3/drives.md) resource reference.

| Query term | Valid operators | Usage | `useDomainAdminAccess` setting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `createdTime` | `<=`, `<`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=` | Date when the shared drive was created. [RFC 3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format, default time zone is UTC, such as `2012-06-04T12:00:00-08:00`. | `true` |
| `hidden` | `=`, `!=` | Specifies whether the shared drive is hidden. Can be either `true` or `false`. | `false` |
| `memberCount` | `<=`, `<`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=` | Number of users and groups that are members of the shared drive. Takes a numerical value. | `true` |
| `name` | `contains`, `=`, `!=` | Name of the shared drive. Surround with single quotes (`'`). Escape single quotes in queries with `\'`, such as `'Valentine\'s Day'`. | `true` |
| `organizerCount` | `<=`, `<`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=` | Number of users and groups that are organizers of the shared drive. Takes a numerical value. | `true` |
| `orgUnitId` | `=`, `!=` | The organizational unit ID of a shared drive. Takes a string value. | `true` |
