# Create and manage files

This guide explains how to create and manage files in Google Drive using the Google Drive API.

## Create file

To create a file in Drive that contains no metadata or content, use the [`create`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/create) method on the [`files`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files) resource with no parameters.

When you create the file, the method returns a `files` resource. The file is given a `kind` of `drive.file`, an `id`, a `name` of "Untitled", and a `mimeType` of `application/octet-stream`. The [`uploadType`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/create#body.QUERY_PARAMETERS.upload_type) is marked as required but defaults to `media`, so you don't actually have to supply it.

For more information about Drive file limits, see [File and folder limits](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/folder#folder-limits).

## Use the fields parameter

If you want to specify the fields to return in the response, you can set the `fields` [system parameter](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/system-parameters#definitions) with any method of the `files` resource. If you omit the `fields` parameter, the server returns a default set of fields specific to the method. For example, the [`list`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/list) method returns only the `kind`, `id`, `name`, `mimeType`, and `resourceKey` fields for each file. To return different fields, see [Return specific fields](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/fields-parameter).

## File ownership

When a file is created using the Drive API, ownership depends on the authentication credentials used by the app in the following ways:

- **User account (OAuth 2.0)**: If the application authenticates on behalf of a user, that user becomes the file owner. The file then resides in their My Drive folder or a [specified folder](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/folder#create-file). It consumes their storage quota.
- **Service Account**: If the application authenticates using a Service Account, the Service Account is the file owner. The file then resides in the Service Account's dedicated Drive storage. Files don't appear within other Drive storage accounts unless explicitly shared. If the Service Account is deleted, all files it owns are deleted immediately.
	If you're using a Service Account but want a specific user account to own a file, use Domain-Wide Delegation. This allows the Service Account to impersonate a user and to create files on their behalf. For more information, see [Delegate domain-wide authority to the service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority).

For more information about file permissions, see [Share files, folders, and drives](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-sharing).

## Generate IDs to use with your files

The [`generateIds`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/generateIds) method on the [`files`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files) resource lets you pre-generate unique file IDs that can be used when creating or copying files and folders in Drive. This can be useful when you need to control the file IDs from your app, rather than letting Drive assign them automatically.

You can set the number of IDs generated using the [`count`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/generateIds#body.QUERY_PARAMETERS.count) query parameter. If `count` is not set, 10 are returned by default. The maximum number of IDs you can request is capped at 1,000.

You can also designate the [`space`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/generateIds#body.QUERY_PARAMETERS.space) in which the IDs can be used and the [`type`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/generateIds#body.QUERY_PARAMETERS.type) of items which the IDs can be used for.

Once an ID is generated, it can be passed to the `create` or `copy` method through the `id` field. This ensures that the created or copied file uses the predetermined ID.

If the file is successfully created or copied, subsequent retries return a `409 Conflict` HTTP status code response and duplicate files aren't created.

Note that pre-generated IDs aren't supported for the creation of Google Workspace files, except for the `application/vnd.google-apps.drive-sdk` and `application/vnd.google-apps.folder` [MIME types](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/mime-types). Similarly, uploads referencing a conversion to a Google Workspace file format aren't supported.

## Create metadata-only files

Metadata-only files contain no content. Metadata is data (such as `name`, `mimeType`, and `createdTime`) that describes the file. Fields like `name` are user-agnostic and appear the same for each user, whereas fields such as `viewedByMeTime` contain user-specific values.

One example of a metadata-only file is a folder with the MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.folder`. For more information, see [Create and populate folders](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/folder). Another example is a shortcut that points to another file on Drive with the MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`. For more information, see [Create a shortcut to a Drive file](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/shortcuts).

## Manage thumbnail images

Thumbnails help users identify Drive files. Drive can automatically generate thumbnails for common file types or you can provide a thumbnail image generated by your app. For more information, see [Upload thumbnails](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/file#upload-thumbnails).

## Copy an existing file

To copy a file, and apply any requested updates, use the [`copy`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/copy) method on the `files` resource. To find the `fileId` to copy, use the [`list`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/list) method.

You can apply updates through patch semantics, meaning you can make partial modifications to a resource. You must explicitly set the fields that you intend to modify in your request. Any fields not included in the request retain their existing values. For more information, see [Working with partial resources](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/performance#partial).

You can pre-set the file ID of the copied file using the [`generateIds`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/generateIds) method. For more information, see [Generate IDs to use with your files](#generate-ids).

Note that you need to use an appropriate [Drive API scope](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/copy#authorization-scopes) to authorize the call. For more information on Drive scopes, see [Choose Google Drive API scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth).

### Limits and considerations

As you prepare to copy files, take note of these limits and considerations:

- **Permissions**:
	- The [`DownloadRestrictionsMetadata`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files#downloadrestrictionsmetadata) object of the [`files`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files) resource determines who can copy the file. For more information, see [Prevent users from downloading, printing, or copying your file](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/content-restrictions#download-print-copy).
		- The [`capabilities.canCopy`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files#File.FIELDS.inlinedField_8) field resource determines whether the user can copy a file. For more information, see [Understand file capabilities](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-sharing#capabilities).
		- The user that created the copy owns the copied file. No other sharing settings from the source file are replicated. If the copy is created in a shared folder, it inherits the permissions of that folder.
		- A copied file's ownership might change and the copy might not inherit the original file's sharing settings. These settings might need to be reset.
- **File management**:
	- Some files, like [third-party shortcuts](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/third-party-shortcuts), can never be copied.
		- You can only copy a file into one parent folder. Specifying multiple parents isn't supported. If the [`parents`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files#File.FIELDS.parents) field isn't specified, the file inherits any discoverable parents from the source file.
		- Even though a folder is a type of file, you can't copy a folder. Instead, create a destination folder and set the `parents` field of the existing files to the destination folder. You can then delete the original source folder.
		- Unless a new filename is specified, the `copy` method produces a file with the same name as the original.
		- Excessive use of `copy` can lead to exceeding your Drive API quota limits. For more information, see [Usage limits](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/limits).
