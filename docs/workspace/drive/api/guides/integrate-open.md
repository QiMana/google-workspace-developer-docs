# Integrate with Drive UI's "Open with" context menu

When a user selects a file and clicks the [Drive UI's "Open with" menu item](./about-apps.md#open), Drive redirects the user to that app's Open URL defined in [Configure a Drive UI integration](./enable-sdk.md).

If you checked the "Importing" box when you configured a Drive UI integration, the user can select a combination of app-specific and Google Workspace files to open. When you configure a Drive UI integration, app-specific files are defined in the "Default MIME types" and "Default file extensions" fields, whereas Google Workspace files are defined in the "Secondary MIME types" and "Secondary file extensions" fields.

For each file that the user wants to open, Drive checks the MIME types against your defined default and secondary MIME types:

- For MIME types defined in the "Default MIME types" field, the file ID is passed to your app. For information on how to handle app-specific files, see [Handle an Open URL for app-specific documents](#app).
- For MIME types defined in the "Secondary MIME types" field, the Drive UI displays a dialog asking the user what file type to convert the Google Workspace file to. For example, if you select a Google Docs file in the Drive UI and the "Secondary MIME types" field suggests your app supports text/plain or application/pdf, the Drive UI asks the user if they want to convert to Plain Text or PDF.
	For information on how to handle Google Workspace files, see [Handle an Open URL for Google Workspace documents](#specific). For a list of Google Workspace documents and MIME type conversion formats, see [Export MIME types for Google Workspace documents](./ref-export-formats.md).

## Handle an Open URL for app-specific documents

As mentioned in [Configure a Drive UI integration](./enable-sdk.md), your app receives template variables with information for your app to open the file. Your app receives a default set of template variables within a [`state`](./enable-sdk.md#construct) parameter. The default `state` information for an app-specific Open URL is:

```
{
  "ids": ["ID"],
  "resourceKeys":{"RESOURCE_KEYS":"RESOURCE_KEYS"},
  "action":"open",
  "userId":"USER_ID"
}
```

This output includes the following values:

- ID: The ID of the parent folder.
- RESOURCE\_KEYS: A JSON dictionary of file IDs mapped to their respective resource keys.
- `open`: The action being performed. The value is `open` when using an Open URL.
- USER\_ID: The profile ID that uniquely identifies the user.

Your app must act on this request by following these steps:

1. Verify that the `action` field has a value of `open` and the `ids` field is present.
2. Use the `userId` value to create a new session for the user. For more information on signed-in users, see [Users & new events](#potential-logins).
3. Use the [`files.get`](../reference/rest/v3/files/get.md) method to check permissions, fetch file metadata, and download the file content using the `ID` values.
4. If `resourceKeys` was set on the request, set the `X-Goog-Drive-Resource-Keys` request header. For more information on resource keys, see [Access link-shared files using resource keys](./resource-keys.md).

The `state` parameter is URL-encoded, so your app must handle the escape characters and parse it as JSON.

## Handle an Open URL for Google Workspace documents

As mentioned in [Configure a Drive UI integration](./enable-sdk.md), your app receives a default set of template variables within a [`state`](./enable-sdk.md#construct) parameter. The default `state` information for a Google Workspace Open URL is:

```
{
  "exportIds": ["ID"],
  "resourceKeys":{"RESOURCE_KEYS":"RESOURCE_KEYS"},
  "action":"open",
  "userId":"USER_ID"
}
```

This output includes the following values:

- EXPORT\_ID: A comma-separated list of file IDs being exported. Used only when opening Google Workspace files.
- RESOURCE\_KEYS: A JSON dictionary of file IDs mapped to their respective resource keys.
- `open`: The action being performed. The value is `open` when using an Open URL.
- USER\_ID: The profile ID that identifies the user.

Your app must act on this request by following these steps:

1. Verify that this is a request to open a file by detecting both the `open` value in the `state` field and the presence of the `exportIds` field.
2. Use the [`files.get`](../reference/rest/v3/files/get.md) method to check permissions, fetch file metadata, and determine the MIME type using the `EXPORT_ID` values.
3. Convert the file content using the [`files.export`](../reference/rest/v3/files/export.md) method. The following code sample shows how to export a Google Workspace document to the requested MIME type.
4. If `resourceKey` was set on the request, set the `X-Goog-Drive-Resource-Keys` request header. For more information on resource keys, see [Access link-shared files using resource keys](./resource-keys.md).

Display converted files as read-only or present a dialog letting the user to save the file as the new file type.

The `state` parameter is URL-encoded, so your app must handle the escape characters and parse it as JSON.

## Users & new events

Drive apps should treat all "open with" events as potential sign-ins. Some users might have multiple accounts, so the user ID in the `state` parameter might not match the current session. If the user ID in the `state` parameter doesn't match the current session, end the current session for your app and sign in as the requested user.

In addition to opening an application from Google Drive UI, applications can display a file picker to select content from within an app. For more information, see the [Google Picker](./picker.md).
