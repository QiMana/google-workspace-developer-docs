# Integrate with Drive UI's "New" button

When a user clicks [Drive UI's "New" button](./about-apps.md#new) and selects an app in the Drive UI, Drive redirects the user to that app's New URL defined in [Configure a Drive UI integration](./enable-sdk.md).

Your app then receives a default set of template variables within a [`state`](./enable-sdk.md#construct) parameter. The default `state` information for a New URL is:

```
{
  "action":"create",
  "folderId":"FOLDER_ID",
  "folderResourceKey":"FOLDER_RESOURCE_KEY",
  "userId":"USER_ID"
}
```

This output includes the following values:

- `create`: The action being performed. The value is `create` when a user clicks [Drive UI's "New" button](./about-apps.md#new).
- FOLDER\_ID: The ID of the parent folder.
- FOLDER\_RESOURCE\_KEY: The resource key of the parent folder.
- USER\_ID: The profile ID that uniquely identifies the user.

Your app must act on this request by following these steps:

1. Verify that the `action` field has a value of `create`.
2. Use the `userId` value to create a new session for the user. For more information on signed-in users, see [Users & new events](#potential-logins).
3. Use the [`files.create`](../reference/rest/v3/files/create.md) method to create a file resource. If `folderId` was set on the request, set the `parents` field to the `folderId` value.
4. If `folderResourceKey` was set on the request, set the `X-Goog-Drive-Resource-Keys` request header. For more information on resource keys, see [Access link-shared files using resource keys](./resource-keys.md).

The `state` parameter is URL-encoded, so your app must handle the escape characters and parse it as JSON.

## Users & new events

Drive apps should treat all "create" events as potential sign-ins. Some users might have multiple accounts, so the user ID in the `state` parameter might not match the current session. If the user ID in the `state` parameter doesn't match the current session, end the current session for your app and sign in as the requested user.
